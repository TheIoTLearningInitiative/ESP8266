# Arest

> The aREST framework is a complete solution to build powerful RESTful applications based on the Arduino & the Raspberry Pi platforms. It can handle all kind of communications via Serial, WiFi, Ethernet, and much more. It includes libraries for boards themselves, like Arduino boards, and also server-side code to handle the communications between a server and remote devices. The aREST framework is of course completely open-source and free to use. [Homepage](https://arest.io)
